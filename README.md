# UDE
UDE is a Java desktop environment that has both a file manager and desktop.
<br/>
<h2>Goals:</h2>
<hr/>
1. Make an easily customizable desktop environment.<br/>
2. Allow for fancy effects.<br/>
3. Mimic some of the old effects such as cube selection, grid wall selection, etc. <br/>
4. Push the boundaries of what we consider a desktop. Try aiming for a 3D environment or just do something unique.
<br/>
<h2>Current Phase:</h2>
<hr/>
Currently, I'm looking at who's interested in contributing and creating an actual game plan for proceeding.<br/>
I'll be updating this section as the situation develops.
 <br/>
<h2>Todo List:</h2>
<hr/>
1. Implement a plan of attack and goals.<br/>
2. Pretty much re-write everything.<br/>
3. Focus on modularity.
